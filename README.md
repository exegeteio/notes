# Notes

This repository contains all my public notes on technology, life, etc.

## Why? 

I want my notes to be public.  That may seem a bit odd, but I feel like sometimes my insights may be
useful to those beyond myself.  I tend to write notes in Markdown and will continue to do so.

Maybe in the future I'll try to publish these to exegete.io, not sure.

## How?

My notes are written in vim, using a
[quick-and-dirty script](https://github.com/exegeteio/dotfiles/blob/main/bin/n)
optimized for getting me writing.  This is something I can open quickly on any machine, as my
dotfiles are one of the first things I install on any machine.  A simple, `n` will get me to where
I want to go.
